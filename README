My entry to http://contest.github.com/.

This started as the simplest method I could imagine: recommend the
most popular repos not already followed.

I'm surprised it did as well as it did. I tried to refine it a bit by
also recommending the most popular repos that use languages already
watched by the user in question; but that almost doubled the size of
the code, to 100 lines, and added only 0.4% to the score. Never got
back to the fancier ideas I'd like to have explored.
